Piano Progressive Web App.

My motivation for creating this project was to give my 1 year old son
something to play the piano on my phone.

The webapp loads 1 mp3, the C4 note, and then modify the playback rate
of the mp3 to emulate the different notes of the piano.

The most baby-friendly way to hand this to a baby is to:

* Load this site on an Android
* Add the pwa to your desktop
* Open it
* Pin it (so they can't change the active app)

## Notes

C4.mp3 was purchased from https://www.soundsnap.com/node/21844.
